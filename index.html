	<h2> About My Birthdays </h2>
	<p> I was born in Yokosuka, Japan on December 27th. Being 2 days after christmas, most things are closed
		so most events we did in Janurary. Personally I like having a december birthday, christmas is my favorite
		time of year so having a birthday right after makes it more enjoyable. It's also much easier to think about 
		when thinking back concerning birthdays because its right at the end of the year.</p>
		
	<p> For some reason I get asked a lot if I get less presents because its right after christmas, but my family always just waited 
		2 days and then gave me a birthday gift as well. I also get asked a lot if I know japanese since I was born in Japan, but unfortunatley I do not. </p>
